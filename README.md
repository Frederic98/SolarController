# SolarController

## API
A JSON API server is running on the Raspberry Pi to read the temperatures and other inputs,
and write outputs (like relay states) to the microcontroller.

## UI
A little screen in the controller displays the current temperatures and relay states.  
The current IP addresses of the controller are also displayed so you can connect to the web interface / API.

## SSH
To reduce vulnerabilities in this relatively critical controller, the SSH server is disabled by default.  
Only when the user presses a physical button on the controller, SSH is enabled for 15 minutes. After this, the server is stopped again and new connections can not be made anymore.
Existing connections will stay active.

## Systemd
Systemd unit files are made for the API, UI and SSH scripts. Enable the services to have them auto start at boot.

## MCU
The microcontroller on the PCB periodically reads the temperature sensors and controls the relays states.  
Normally, the Raspberry Pi should tell the microcontroller to open or close a relay.
For safety however, the microcontroller should also have an emergency override for when the temperatures get too high (>95Â°C?) to force the relays closed, so the pumps start pumping.
When all temperatures are low enough again, it should hand over control back to the Raspberry Pi.
